    <h2>DaVinci Resolve : Overview</h2>
    <p>DaVinci Resolve (originally known as da Vinci Resolve) is a color grading and non-linear
         video editing (NLE) application for macOS, Windows, and Linux, originally developed by 
         da Vinci Systems, and now developed by Blackmagic Design following its acquisition in 2009.
         In addition to the commercial version of the software (known as DaVinci Resolve Studio), 
         Blackmagic Design also distributes a free edition, with reduced functionality, simply
        named DaVinci Resolve (formerly known as DaVinci Resolve Lite).</p>

    <h2>DaVinci Resolve : Features</h2>
    <p>Honestly, Resolve is JUST. LIKE. PREMIERE. and by that you can already assume that like premiere 
        Resolve has also COUNTLESS. features! Here are some best of them:
    <li>Hide The Page Icons</li>
    <p>Extra real estate is always welcomed by video editors, especially for those who work on a laptop. Resolve 16 allows you to hide the page icons to get a few more pixels for your graphical user interface (GUI). To hide the page icons, go to “Workspace” then un-check “Show Page Navigation.”

        You can also hide individual pages. Do this by going to Workspace > Show Page, then un-check all the pages you want to hide.
        
        The benefit of having this feature is that you can also limit access to other pages. 
        For example, if you hire a freelance colorist, you can turn on only the color page for them.
         This ensures that there will be no accidental changes in your final edit. They can still turn on
          the other pages, but it at least ensures nothing goes wrong unintentionally.</p>
    </p>
    <li>Frame.io Integration (Studio Version)</li>
    <p>Resolve 16 includes integration with Frame.io, a cloud-based platform where you and your 
        team can upload and share your videos for reviews and approval. (Pond5 also has a Frame.io 
        integration, in case you didn’t know!) You can enable the Frame.io integration in DaVinci Resolve
         by going to the Internet Accounts panel in the System tab of your DaVinci Resolve Preferences. 
         You can also specify a local cache location for all the media being synced with Frame.io.
        Uploading straight to Frame.io is also possible in Resolve 16. On the Deliver page, go to 
        the Render Settings, choose Frame.io, and tweak accordingly. The location field changes to 
        “Upload To” so you can specify which folder you want to upload your project to in Frame.io.</p>
    <li>Image Stabilization</li>
    <p>Another welcome addition is Image Stabilization in the Inspector panel. Before, you had to 
        go to the Color page in order to stabilize a clip. In Resolve 16, you can now stabilize clips 
        in the Cut or Edit page. Just select your clip and open the Inspector panel, expand the Stabilization
         segment, and click “Stabilize.” You can tweak the settings as you need to, and you can also click 
         on “Camera Lock” to eliminate any camera movement in your shot.</p>
    <li>Quick Export</li>
    <p>Exporting your projects has always involved going to the Deliver page, but now you can do 
        a quick export from the Cut and Edit page, and there are a variety of presets you can choose
         from. You can also create your own presets by going to the Render Settings panel options 
         and choosing “Preset” in the Quick Exports submenu.</p>
    <li>Warning When Rendering Bigger Than Timeline</li>
    <p>Sometimes you’re tired from working too long, and you make mistakes, like forgetting to correctly set your export resolution. (What, is that just me?) Now Resolve will show a warning window if you’re rendering your timeline to a bigger resolution, so you can choose to Add or Cancel the render, instead of missing the error.</p>

    <h2>DaVinci Resolve : History</h2>

        <details>
    <summary>da Vinci Systems development (2003–2009)</summary> 
    <p>The initial versions of DaVinci Resolve (known then as da Vinci Resolve) were resolution-independent 
        software tools, developed by da Vinci Systems (based in Coral Springs, Florida), who had previously
         produced other color correction systems, such as da Vinci Classic (1985), da Vinci Renaissance (1990),
          and da Vinci 2K (1998). The system was first announced in 2003 and released in 2004.
          It began with three possible configurations: a digital intermediate (DI) color correction tool 
          (known as Resolve DI), a visual effects tool (known as Resolve FX), and a 2K resolution processing
          tool (known as Resolve RT).
          [4] These initial versions were integrated exclusively into dedicated hardware controllers.</p>
    <p>The systems leveraged parallel processing in an InfiniBand topology to support performance during color grading.
         This was initially implemented using proprietary hardware cards; however, the 4K resolution Resolve R series
          (such as the R-100, introduced in 2008, and the stereoscopic 3D R-360-3D, introduced in 2009) replaced this proprietary 
          hardware with CUDA-based NVIDIA GPUs.</p>
    <p>In 2009, the Australian video processing and distribution technology company Blackmagic Design bought da Vinci Systems,
         retaining and expanding the engineering team for Resolve, but eliminating support-based contracts for the tool.
          In October 2009, Blackmagic Design CEO Grant Petty speculated in an interview that the price of Resolve could likely
           be reduced to below $100,000.</p>

        <summary>Design versions (2010–present)</summary>
        <p>At NAB 2010 in Las Vegas, in April 2010, Blackmagic Design announced three new pricing models for Resolve, 
            with a new software-only macOS version retailing for $995, the macOS version with the Advanced Control Surface
             (previously branded as Impresario by da Vinci Systems) retailing for $29,995, and licenses for the Linux version
              (supporting multiple-GPUs for increased performance) retailing at $19,995 (with the most advanced configuration
               available retailing for under $150,000). Before this change, the pre-built versions of Resolve had been the
                only available options, selling for between $200,000 and $800,000, which was common industry practice at the time.
                 In September 2010, version 7 (restyled as DaVinci Resolve) was the first to be released by Blackmagic Design
                  under the new pricing model, and the first release for macOS. It included a redesigned user interface, Apple
                   ProRes support, and support for the RED Rocket digital video decoder boards manufactured by Red Digital Cinema.</p>
        <p>The pricing model changes continued in June 2011 with the release of version 8: As part of this new version, 
            Blackmagic Design announced a free, reduced-functionality edition of the software (known as DaVinci Resolve 8 Lite), 
            alongside the continuing commercial options. Version 8 also introduced OpenCL acceleration support and XML 
            integration with non-linear editor (NLE) applications. Subsequently, version 8.2 (December 2011) further expanded
             the scope of the software (which was previously only available for macOS and Linux) with the first release for 
             the Windows platform, beginning with a public beta.</p>
